### Week 5 Achievements:

* Understand AWS security services: 
  * Shared Responsibility Model: The AWS security model defines the division of responsibilities between AWS and customers in protecting systems and data on the cloud platform.
  * AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM): Manages user identities, roles, and permissions to securely control access to AWS resources.
  * Amazon Cognito: Provides authentication, authorization, and user management for web and mobile applications. 
  * AWS Organization & AWS Identity Center (SSO): Enables centralized management of multiple AWS accounts, unified access control, and single sign-on for users across the organization.
  * AWS KMS: Manages encryption keys used to protect data, allowing secure creation, storage, and control of keys.

* Understand the structure of AWS Security Hub.
* Successfully completed Lab 22 & 27.
