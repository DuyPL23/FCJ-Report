### Week 6 Achievements:
* Learned how to manage access to EC2 services using Resource Tags with AWS IAM.
* Successfully completed Lab 30 & 33, understanding IAM Permission Boundaries (limiting user permissions) and data encryption at rest using AWS KMS.
* Gained deeper understanding of IAM Roles & Conditions, and how to grant applications access to AWS services using IAM Roles.
* Acquired additional knowledge about AWS Database Services:
  * Database Concepts
  * Amazon RDS: A managed relational database service that supports multiple database engines such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Oracle, and SQL Server. It automates tasks like backup, patching, and scaling.
  * Amazon Aurora: A high-performance, fully managed relational database compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL, designed for scalability and high availability.
  * Amazon RedShift: A fully managed data warehouse service optimized for large-scale data analysis (OLAP) and big data analytics.
  * Amazon ElastiCache: A managed in-memory caching service supporting Redis and Memcached, improving application performance by reducing database load and query latency.
